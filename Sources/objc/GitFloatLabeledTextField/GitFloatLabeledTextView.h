/**
 * `GitFloatLabeledTextView` is a `UITextView` subclass that implements the "Float Label Pattern".
 *
 * Due to space constraints on mobile devices, it is common to rely solely on placeholders as a means to label fields.
 * This presents a UX problem, in that, once the user begins to fill out a form, no labels are present.
 *
 * `GitFloatLabeledTextView` aims to improve the user experience by having placeholders transition into "floating labels"
 * that hover above the text view after it is populated with text.
 *
 * GitFloatLabeledTextView supports iOS 7+.
 *
 * Credits for the concept to Matt D. Smith (@mds), and his original design:  http://mattdsmith.com/float-label-pattern/
